# GraphQL Full-Stack Project

This project is implemented with a React Client App and a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) server in NodeJS.

Everything is implemented from scratch.

## Built With
As general, I am using **ESLint** for Typescript code style checking, and **Docker** for containerization.

For the client, I am using

* Webpack
* React
* Typescript
* [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) - A library to use GraphQL to build client applications.
* [BlueprintJS](https://blueprintjs.com/) - A React-based UI toolkit for the web.

For the server, I am using

* NodeJS
* Typescript
* [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - A Schema-based MongoDB client for NodeJS

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For running the app in your local you need to have **NodeJS** and **MongoDB** installed.

For testing the containerization, you need to have **Docker** installed.

### Installing
Start the mongo instance with docker:
```bash
# Start a mongo container
docker-compose -d up mongo

# Copy the mock data into container
docker cp server/mock/users.json mongo:/tmp/users.json

# Import the mock data
docker exec mongo mongoimport -d demo -c users --file /tmp/users.json
```

Running the app:
```bash
cd app
npm install
npm start
```

Running the server

```
cd server
npm install
npm start:dev
```

After this you should be able to see the web app is lanched in `http://localhost:3000` and the server is in `http://localhost:4000`, webpack-dev-sever should proxy the `/graphql` endpoint to the server.
